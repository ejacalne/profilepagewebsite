        <p>Hi! I'm Ella Jacalne, a 2nd-year BSIT student at Bataan Peninsula State Universty. I'm still learning and growing in my field, taking things at my own pace. While IT is my current path, my true pasion lies beyond this field, and I'm determined to pursue it in the future. Every step I take brings me closer to the dream I'm reaching for, and I believe that with patience  and perseverance, I’ll get there. For now, I’m gaining knowledge, building skills, and preparing myself for whatever the future holds!</p>
